# Hooks — keeping the disciplines present

The Codex only works if it's *in context* when the agent acts. A one-time paste into
`AGENTS.md` works; a hook makes it automatic, every session, and opens each run with the
maxim and a proverb.

## `session-start.sh`

Emits, to stdout:

1. The **fixed maxim** (the heart of Ubuntu) + a rotating **proverb of the day**
   (`bin/precept`, drawn from `proverbs.txt`).
2. The **conduct block** — the four disciplines, precedence, and the hard limit
   (`codex-block.md`).

It's harness-agnostic: any harness that can run a command at session start can use it, and
its stdout is plain readable text.

## Wiring it into Claude Code

Claude Code injects a `SessionStart` hook's stdout into the session context. Add to your
`settings.json` (use the **absolute** path, and check your Claude Code version's hook docs —
the schema evolves):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "/abs/path/to/ubuntu-harness/hooks/session-start.sh" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Wiring it into any other harness

Run `hooks/session-start.sh` as the first step of your session bootstrap and prepend its
output to the system prompt. The maxim goes first, the disciplines stay present.

## Just want to see it?

```sh
./hooks/session-start.sh
